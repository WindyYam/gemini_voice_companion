# This file contains python APIs to be used in code snippet for execution
# The code in python code snippet in your response will get automatically executed
# To get the execution result in the python code, call load_value(val) on the value, the system will send the value content to you.

# The following are the APIs for searching and reading through the web
# To read information you must always use load_value(str) on the returned info
##########################################################
# get the current city name

# online search for any information from web search engine, e.g. news, weather, which returns several links and brief descriptions. 
# typical usage: load_value(webSearch(query))
# after the search, always get more detail by get_webpage_text() call to the most relative link from the search result. 
# to get multiple web contents in one go, combine the text into a dict and then call load_value(dict)
# after getting detail, summarize the highlights from all the gathered information in a short concise way.
webSearch(query:str)->str

# get webpage content text. always call this to get the detail on the most relevant link after web search.
